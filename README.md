Based on the provided sources, here is a summary of how K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering was utilized to recommend books with similar ratings using a Streamlit app:

The project involved the creation of a Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System using KNN clustering. The system simplifies book selection by recommending similar books based on user input, enhancing the reading experience. It provides a list of the top 5 similar books for a specific search, making book selection more personalized and engaging. To run the code, users need to install Streamlit using pip install streamlit and then run the app using the command streamlit run app.py. The system leverages the KNN algorithm to recommend books based on similarities between users and items, providing tailored recommendations based on user preferences. Additionally, the project showcases the use of a slider bar on a Streamlit web app to allow users to select their preferred books and receive recommendations for similar books, demonstrating the versatility and user-centric design of the recommendation system.

This summary encapsulates the essence of how KNN clustering was employed to recommend books with similar ratings through a user-friendly Streamlit app, enhancing the book selection process for users.
